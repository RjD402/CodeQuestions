height of a balanced binary seach tree = log2n
where n = number of nodes in the binary tree

Three type of traversal in a binary search tree are
a. Inorder traversal (Left, Node, Right)
b. Preorder traversal (Node, Left, Right)
c. Post order traversal (Left, Right, Node)


The Inorder traversal of a binary search tree is a sorted array of numbers
